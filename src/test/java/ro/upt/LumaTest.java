    /*
        VERY IMPORTANT: While implementing the tests, you may notice that the web page is slower than the one tested
        in the previous week. After interacting with elements that redirect to another page (such as buttons), please
        make sure you add Thread.sleep() calls, depending on how slow the page loads.

        e.g. Thread.sleep(1000) will make the test Thread wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds), meaning that before
        you do an Assertion, you should wait until the new page fully loads all of the components.

        NOTICE: Selenium may still find elements even without Thread.sleep(), but it may find the elements from the old
        page, and show differences in your assertions. Make sure you properly add the statements if required.
